<p>So, components are kind of important. It wouldn’t be much of a pattern library without them. Fortunately, we’ve streamlined the process for adding and updating them so making them is a snap.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update a Component</h3>

<p>Your components are found in the <em>src/html/components</em> directory. To make updates, you can simply open the HTML file and make your changes. Bing, bang, boom!</p>

<h3 id="create">Create a Component</h3>

<p>The easiest way to create a new component is to duplicate an existing one from the <em>src/html/components</em> directory and change the file name. The file name can be anything you like, and you can create subdirectories for your components to help organize things better.</p>

<p>Components have HTML comments at the top to allow you to give them a name and a summary. This information will appear above the component when viewed in the pattern library.</p>

<h3 id="add-to-menu">Adding a Component to the Main Menu</h3>

<p>Before a component actually appears in the pattern library, you will need to tell RPL where to place it in the menu. By default, you will see that the components section of the main navigation has a few groups where components are placed (such as Page Structure or Lists). You should know that these groups are customizable, and we expect you to modify them to your own needs. To do this, you will need to modify the <em>rpl-assets/rpl-config.json</em> file.</p>

<p>There is a <code>navigation</code> key in the RPL config JSON file that contains all of the information for the main menu. This is where you will configure the groups available to your components. Give each group a name and a URI. The URI can be anything as long as it begins with <strong>components/</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve decided on which group to use for your component, you need to add it to that group. In the same JSON file, you should see a <code>components</code> key. It contains an array of component groups, and each group has a <code>list</code> value that controls which components appear there. First, ensure that any changes that you made to the groups in the navigation are reflected here, and then add your component to the list.</p>

<h4>JSON Component Settings</h4>

<table class="rpl-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>uriKey</th>
      <td>Matches the component group URI value from the navigation without the <strong>components/</strong> part.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>heading</th>
      <td>Appears at the top of the page when the component group is viewed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>description</th>
      <td>Appears below the heading at the top of the page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>list</th>
      <td>A list of the components to add to the page. Each item in the list has a <code>title</code> (the text to use in the menu) and a <code>uri</code> (the component file path relataive to the <em>src/html</em> directory and without the <em>.html</em> extension.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="add-to-page">Including a Component on a Page or from another Component</h3>

<p>If you had to type out the HTML every time you wanted to use a component, that would be a problem. Fortunately, that’s not the case. To include a component on one of your HTML pages (or from within another component), add a comment in the following format: </p>

<div class="rpl-note"><code>&lt;!-- build:include <em>path/to/component.html</em> --&gt;&lt;!-- /build --&gt;</code></div>

<p>The path to your component is relative to the file where it is being included. For example, if you have a component at <em>src/html/components/parent-component.html</em> and you want to include a component from <em>src/html/components/children/child-component.html</em>, you would use the following:</p>

<div class="rpl-note"><code>&lt;!-- build:include children/child-component.html --&gt;&lt;!-- /build --&gt;</code></div>

<h3 id="advanced">Advanced Usage</h3>

<h4>Default Component Width and Height</h4>

<p>Some of your components may be best displayed at a smaller width or height. It can be incovenient to have to scroll past a large component, and that’s why we’ve made it possible to set default dimensions for components. Users can always resize the component using the resize handle if desired.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>DefaultDims</strong> value in your component comments to set the width and height.</p>

<div class="rpl-note"><pre><code>&lt!--
  Name: Sample Component with Default Dimensions
  Summary: This component will display at 25rem × 10rem.
  DefaultDims: 25rem, 10rem
--&gt;</code></pre></div>

<p>If you only need to set the width, simply leave off the comma and height value.</p>

<h4>Component Dependencies</h4>

<p>Sometimes, it’s necessary for multiple components to share a resource that should only be included once on a page. For example, you may have an SVG image where you want to reference parts of it with &lt;use&gt; tags. It wouldn’t make sense to include that SVG in every component as it only needs to appear once per page. So, instead, we can add that SVG as a dependency of those components.</p>
<p>We start by creating a file for the dependency, such as <em>src/html/components/dependencies/icons.svg</em>. Then, we reference that file from a component by adding it to the HTML comments at the top.</p>

<div class="rpl-note"><pre><code>&lt!--
Name: Sample Component with Dependencies
Summary: This component has dependencies on an SVG and an HTML file.
Depends: dependencies/icons.svg,
         dependencies/sample.html
--&gt;</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that there can be multiple dependencies, separated by commas. See the <a href="components/callouts">Call-out sample component</a> for an example of this concept in action.</p>


<div class="rpl-note">
  <p>Note: Dependencies are hidden when viewed in the pattern library, as they are not part of the component itself, but a shared resource.</p>
</div>

<h4>Component Backgrounds</h4>

<p>By default, components are placed on a checkerboard background, which is helpful for showing what areas of a component are transparent. But, in some cases, a component may be difficult to see against this background, or maybe it will never be used except against a specific colored background. In these cases, you may specify a background color to use for the component by adding a <strong>Background</strong> value to the HTML comments.</p>

<div class="rpl-note"><pre><code>&lt!--
Name: Sample Component with Background
Summary: This component has has a red background when viewed in RPL.
Background: #f00
--&gt;</code></pre></div>

<p>Backgrounds are only applied when the component is viewed in RPL. If the component should always have a background, apply it using your style sheets.</p>

<p>Backgrounds also propagate to parent components. If this causes a problem, you can apply the default checkerboard background to the parent component by setting the background value to <strong>revert</strong>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="components/lists">Link List sample component</a> for an example of how to apply a background.</p>

<h4>Responsive Design and Container Queries</h4>

<p>Almost any website today is going to make use of responsive design. One problem that we still face is that we can only write CSS media queries that are relative to the viewport. However, in many cases, we need media queries to be based on a parent element. This is often referred to as a container query.</p>

<p>RPL displays components with some padding around them and with a sidebar to the right (depending on the viewport width). This means that some components that rely on media queries may not render as expected when viewed in the pattern library. To remedy this, you can tell RPL about your CSS breakpoints in the <em>rpl-config.json</em> file.</p>

<div class="rpl-note"><pre><code>{
  "styleBreakpoints": {
    "rpl-sm": 480,
    "rpl-md": 800,
    "rpl-lg": 1024
  }
}</code></pre></div>

<p>RPL will automatically add a class attribute to the container of each component according to the width of the component. For example, using the configuration above, a component that is 900px wide will be given a class of <strong>rpl-sm rpl-md</strong> since it is larger than 800px but smaller than 1024px.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how you could style a component based on these classes.</p>

<div class="rpl-note"><pre><code>.my-component {
  display: block;
}

@media (min-width: 800px) {
  .page-wrapper,
  .rpl-md {
    .my-component {
      display: flex;
    }
  }
}</code></pre></div>

<p>The component will have a block display on viewports smaller than 800px, but if the component is used on a page outside of RPL (denoted by the <strong>page-wrapper</strong> class) that is 800px wide or more, then a flex display will be used. The flex display will also be used within RPL if the component itself is 800px wide or more (denoted by the <strong>rpl-md</strong> class).</p>

<p>To see an example of this concept in action, take a look at the styles for the sample <a href="/pattern-lib/components/images#thumbnail-grid">Thumbnail Grid</a> component. The number of columns will change based on how much space is available to the component.</p>

<div class="rpl-note">Note: This container query solution only works within RPL. Your actual pages will not be able to make use of the RPL class names. If you are interested in using this solution in your pages as well, see <a href="https://philipwalton.com/articles/responsive-components-a-solution-to-the-container-queries-problem/">Responsive Components: a Solution to the Container Queries Problem</a>.</div>
