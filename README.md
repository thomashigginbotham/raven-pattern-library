# Raven Pattern Library

RPL is a living style guide and component-driven front-end development resource. As you make changes to the styles and components used by your web site or application, the pattern library will automatically update to reflect those changes.

## Requirements

* [Node.js/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting Started

Use your preferred method to download the files.

* Git: `git clone https://github.com/thomashigginbotham/raven-pattern-library.git`
* [Download a ZIP file](https://github.com/thomashigginbotham/raven-pattern-library/archive/master.zip)

### Installation

1. From the command line, change to the directory where the files were downloaded.
1. Run `npm install`.

### Usage

Run `npm run serve` to start a development server that watches for changes. (Note: using `npm run serve -- -o` will automatically open your browser to the correct URL.)

When youâ€™re ready to publish, use `npm run build` to create a **dist** folder, ready for deployment on another server.
