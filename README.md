# Raven Pattern Library

RPL is a living style guide and component-driven front-end development resource. As you make changes to the styles and components used by your web site or application, the pattern library will automatically update to reflect those changes.

## Requirements

* [Node.js/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki)

## Getting Started

Use your preferred method to download the files.

* Git: `git clone https://github.com/thomashigginbotham/raven-pattern-library.git`
* [Download a ZIP file](https://github.com/thomashigginbotham/raven-pattern-library/archive/master.zip)

### Installation

1. From the command line, change to the directory where the files were downloaded.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm run build-ng`.

### Usage

Run `npm run serve` to start a development server that watches for changes. When youâ€™re ready to publish, use `npm run build` to create a **dist** folder, ready for deployment on another server.

*Note: Use `npm run serve -- -o` to automatically open your browser.*
