Summary: A reference for code contributors.

<p>It is up to you and your team to decide on coding style practices. At times there can be a lot of disagreement about whether to indent with spaces or tabs, how to order your CSS properties, or a myriad of other coding preferences. However, we can all agree that when the whole team follows the same rules, the project is better for it. This page can act as a reference guide for those decisions.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples to get you started.</p>
