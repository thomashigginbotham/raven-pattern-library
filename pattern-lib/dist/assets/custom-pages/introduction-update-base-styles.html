Name: Introduction/Updating Base Styles
Summary: How to update typography, color, buttons, and more.
-->
<p>Unlike components, where styles are expected to be contained, base styles are global, affecting the entire website. Here you will determine your fonts, colors, and default HTML element styles.</p>

<h3>Quick Links</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="./introduction/update-base-styles#typography">Typography updates</a></li>
  <li><a href="./introduction/update-base-styles#color">Color updates</a></li>
  <li><a href="./introduction/update-base-styles#other">Other base styles</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="typography">Typography</h3>

The <a href="./styles/typography">Typography page</a> automatically pulls information regarding your fonts from your styles. This page is a quick way to view how your fonts will appear across various heading levels and when applied to paragraphs and lists. No additional setup is required.

<h3 id="color">Color</h3>

<p>The <a href="./styles/color">Color page</a>, like the Typography page, is also self-updating. However, it receives its information by reading your <em>/scss/modules/_vars.scss</em> file. Color variables found within the file will be displayed on the page.</p>
<p>There are four types of colors: brand, accent, utility, and neutral.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Type</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Brand</th>
      <td>A website’s primary colors. For example, Pepsi’s brand colors are red, white, and blue. Any Sass variable beginning with <strong>$color-brand-</strong> will be added to this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Accent</th>
      <td>Colors for minor embellishments. Used when a brand color isn’t appropriate but some color treatment is still needed. Any Sass variable beginning with <strong>$color-accent-</strong> will be added to this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Utility</th>
      <td>Colors with specific meaning. For example, red is often associated with error messages, and green often represents a successful action. Any Sass variable beginning with <strong>$color-utility-</strong> will be added to this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Neutral</th>
      <td>Muted colors, usually shades of grey. Used for backgrounds or content separation. Any Sass variable beginning with <strong>$color-neutral-</strong> will be added to this category.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Variations on a color can also be created. These are displayed as smaller color tiles within a parent tile. To create a color variant, add another hyphen to the end of the color name followed by a name for the variant.</p>

<div class="rpl-note">
  <p>Example: A light version of the primary brand color may have a name like <strong>$color-brand-primary-light</strong> or <strong>$color-brand-primary-90</strong></p>
</div>

<h3 id="other">Other Base Style Pages</h3>

<p>Other base styles can be displayed in the pattern library as well. By default, you will see pages for <a href="./styles/buttons">Buttons</a>, <a href="./styles/forms">Forms</a>, and <a href="./styles/tables">Tables</a>. Unlike the Typography and Color pages, these are custom pages, allowing you full control over the HTML content. You can create more pages like them or remove them altogether.</p>

<p>For more information about creating and managing custom pages, see the <a href="./introduction/custom-pages">Custom Pages</a> section of this guide.</p>
