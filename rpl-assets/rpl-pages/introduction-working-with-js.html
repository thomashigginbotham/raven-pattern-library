Name: Introduction/Working with JavaScript
Summary: How to integrate your JavaScript code.

<p>If your JavaScript needs are fairly lightweight, you can just add some JS files to the <em>src/scripts</em> folder, add a &lt;script&gt; tag to your HTML pages, and call it a day. However, most websites today are going to depend on a bit more than that, and you’ll probably want your components to make use of your scripts when viewed in RPL, not just on your HTML pages.</p>

<h3 id="entrypoint">Script Entrypoint</h3>

<p>If you’ve worked with Node or Webpack, you’re probably familiar with a script entrypoint. It’s a function that kicks off all the scripts that will run on the page. Lucky for you, we went ahead and created one for you. If you look in the <em>src/scripts</em> directory, you’ll see a file called <em>main.js</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>main.js</em> file has an entrypoint function called <code>myScripts.initComponents()</code>. This function is called automatically by RPL every time components are viewed within the pattern library. Outside of the pattern library, the function will be called as long as you include a &lt;script&gt; tag that references the <em>main.js</em> file (we do this for you out of the box).</p>

<p>If you don’t like our entrypoint, you can make your own by editing the <code>initComponentsScript</code> value in the <em>rpl-config.json</em> file. If you choose not to use the <em>main.js</em> file at all, make sure to reference your script files by updating the <code>scriptUris</code> array in the JSON file as well.</p>

<h3 id="bundle">Using a Module Bundler</h3>

<p>If you will be including a moderate amount of JavaScript, we advise using a module bundler like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>. The setup is beyond the scope of this guide, as it will involve changes to <em>gulpfile.js</em> to work with your specific implementation.</p>
