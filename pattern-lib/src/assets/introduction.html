         intended design.

<p>Welcome! If you‘re reading this in your browser, then hopefully, you‘re set up and ready to go. Here‘s what you want to do next.</p>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Replace this introductory content with your own.</li>
  <li>Update the navigation.</li>
  <li>Add your own HTML and styles.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Replace Introductory Content</h3>

<p>The major sections of the pattern library (Introduction, Base Styles, Components, and Pages) can be easily updated. Navigate to the <strong>/pattern-lib/src/assets</strong> directory and look for the appropriate HTML files to change.</p>

<h3>Change the Navigation</h3>

<p>The Components and Pages sections of the navigation start you off with some common elements, but your unique project will certainly require its own set of components and pages. Look in the appropriate sections of the <strong>/pattern-lib/src/assets/rpl-config.json</strong> file to customize the navigation as you see fit.</p>

<h3>Update HTML, Styles, and Scripts</h3>

<p>RPL comes with some basic HTML pages and style sheets. These are here to get you started and familiar with RPL’s structure.</p>

<h4>HTML</h4>

<p>In the <strong>html</strong> directory, you will see three pages: index.html, interior.html, and form.html. Replace their content or remove them as you see fit.</p>
<p>Under the <strong>html</strong> directory is a <strong>components</strong> directory. This is where you will place the components that will be used on the pages. Take a look at them to see how they correlate to the Components section of the pattern library.</p>

<h4>Sass</h4>

<p>The <strong>scss</strong> directory contains all of your style sheets. If you’re new to Sass, don’t feel intimidated. Take a look at the files that are there and play around with them to see what effect your changes make.</p>

<h4>JavaScript</h4>

<p>The <strong>js</strong> directory will house your JavaScript files. To keep things simple, you won’t find any sample JS code.</p>
