<p>Here are some ideas for types of pages to include in your pattern library.</p>

<h3>A Code Style Guide</h3>

<p>It is up to you and your team to decide on coding style practices. At times there can be a lot of disagreement about whether to indent with spaces or tabs, how to order your CSS properties, or a myriad of other coding preferences. However, we can all agree that when the whole team follows the same rules, the project is better for it. This page can act as a reference guide for those decisions.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples to get you started.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html">Google HTML/CSS Style Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style">Mozilla Developer Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/standard/standard">JavaScript Standard Style</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Links and Resources</h3>

<p>When working on a large project, there may be a lot of documentation and files spread over many systems. Whether you need a place to reference your UX designs (personas, user journeys, and wireframes) or your technical documents (content inventory, sitemaps, and data architecture), a page or two in RPL can help keep information within reach.

<h3>Client Deliverables</h3>

<p>Instead of building out your designs and components in a vacuum, consider making incremental updates, and keep your client in the loop. Add special pages for your clients that include notes, links to prototypes, schedules and milestones, or any other information that may be valuable to your client.</p>
