Name: Introduction/Overview
Summary: A bird's eye view of RPL.
-->
<p>At its core, RPL is a means of viewing reusable components of a website. But it’s so much more than that. Here’s what else it does.</p>

<h3>Branding/Style Guide</h3>

<p>Style guides and branding documents provide essential information to help designers and developers create a cohesive website that makes use of complimentary fonts, colors, and whitespace.</p>
<p>RPL takes care of the fonts and colors for you, reading information directly from your style sheets and presenting them in an attractive, usable format for everyone to reference.</p>
<p>To handle other information, such as logo guidelines or rules for how design elements may be used, RPL provides the ability to create your own custom pages with any information you deem important.</p>

<h3>Wiki and Resource Management</h3>

<p>RPL’s custom pages can also be used to provide other information, like a wiki, or offer links to external systems and resources. You could even create a dynamic forum or commenting system by leveraging third-party services like <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.</p>

<h3>Development and Production Deployment</h3>

<p>A pattern library that only acts as a form of documentation can become stagnant or even forgotten entirely. Developers need to be able to make code changes quickly, and remembering to go back and update a style guide or pattern library after the fact is tedious.</p>

<p>That’s why RPL is intended to be used as a development environment. It’s not something that you update separately from your front-end code — it <em>is</em> your front end code. Make updates to your HTML, CSS, JS, images, fonts, whatever, and RPL will automatically watch your changes and present the new information.</p>

<p>When you’re done developing, run a quick build command, and RPL will generate optimized, production-ready code in a flash.</p>
