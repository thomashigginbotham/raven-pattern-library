Summary: How to create and update components.

<p>So, components are kind of important. It wouldn’t be much of a pattern library without them. Fortunately, we’ve streamlined the process for adding and updating them so making them is a snap.</p>

<h3 id="update">Update a Component</h3>

<p>Your components are found in the <em>/html/components</em> directory. To make updates, you can simply open the HTML file and make your changes. Bing, bang boom!</p>

<h3 id="create">Create a Component</h3>

<p>The easiest way to create a new component is to duplicate an existing one from the <em>/html/components</em> directory and change the file name. The file name can be anything you like, and you can create subdirectories for your components to help organize things better.</p>

<p>Components have HTML comments at the top to allow you to give them a name and a summary. This information will appear above the component when viewed in the pattern library.</p>

<h3 id="add-to-menu">Adding a Component to the Main Menu</h3>

<p>Before a component actually appears in the pattern library, you will need to tell RPL where it goes. By default, you will see that the components section of the main navigation has a few groups where components are placed (such as Page Structure or Lists). You should know that these groups are customizable, and we expect you to modify them to your own needs. To do this, you will need to modify the <em>/pattern-lib/src/assets/rpl-config.json</em> file.</p>

<p>You may already be aware of the <code>navigation</code> key in the RPL config JSON file. This is where you will configure the groups available to your components. Give each group a name and a URI. The URI can be anything as long as it begins with <strong>components/</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve decided on which group to use for your component, you need to add it to that group. In the same JSON file, you should see a <code>components</code> key. It contains an array of component groups, and each group has a <code>list</code> value that controls which components appear there. First, ensure that any changes that you made to the groups in the navigation are reflected here, and then add your component to the list.</p>

<h4>JSON Component Settings</h4>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Key</th>
      <th>Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>uriKey</th>
      <td>Matches the component group URI value from the navigation without the <strong>components/</strong> part.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>heading</th>
      <td>Appears at the top of the page when the component group is viewed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>description</th>
      <td>Appears below the heading at the top of the page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>list</th>
      <td>A list of the components to add to the page. Each item in the list has a <code>title</code> (the text to use in the menu) and a <code>uri</code> (the component file path relataive to the <em>/html</em> directory and without the <em>.html</em> extension.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="add-to-page">Including a Component on a Page or from another Component</h3>

<p>If you had to type out the HTML every time you wanted to use a component, that would be a problem. Fortunately, that’s not the case. To include a component on one of your HTML pages (or from within another component), add a comment in the following format: </p>

<div class="rpl-note"><code>&lt;!-- build:include <em>path/to/component.html</em> --&gt;&lt;!-- /build --&gt;</code></div>

<p>The path to your component is relative to the file where it is being included. For example, if you have a component at <em>/html/components/parent-component.html</em> and you want to include a component from <em>/html/components/children/child-component.html</em>, you would use the following:</p>

<div class="rpl-note"><code>&lt;!-- build:include children/child-component.html --&gt;&lt;!-- /build --&gt;</code></div>
